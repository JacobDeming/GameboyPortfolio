Unlike my friends who simply enjoyed playing games as a means to unwind and pass the time, however, I found myself growing more and more interested in the actual study of video games and those techniques by which developers create digital playgrounds.\n    <br><br>\n    While the interactive nature of games and the puzzling complexity of their design were those elements that originally drew me into the field of Media Studies, I soon found myself following the path of an independent developer after graduation and found a deep-rooted desire to develop my own coding skills with the ultimate objective of joining in the design process fully. It is for this reason that I have entered into Rutgers' Coding Boot Camp and taken my first steps towards becoming a proficient coder, designer, and developer.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  ",
